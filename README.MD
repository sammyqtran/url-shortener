# A URL Shortener

## Architecture

### Component Breakdown:
- **gateway-service**: Accepts REST requests and forwards them via gRPC to internal services.
- **url-service**: Core logic service that generates shortcodes and persists mappings to PostgreSQL.
- **analytics-service**: Subscribes to Redis Streams to consume and log access events asynchronously.
- **Redis**: Acts as the message broker using Redis Streams for event delivery.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores URL mappings and access statistics.


### Tech Stack:
- Language: Go
- Protocol: gRPC, REST
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, Redis Streams, PostgreSQL
- CI: Github Actions

### Data Flow:
- HTTP REST request -> Gateway -> gRPC -> url-service
- gateway-service publishes access events to Redis Stream â†’ analytics-service consumes and logs them

## Intent 
- Simulate a production grade microservices architecture in a monorepo setup.
- Practice platform engineering skills including service orchestration, containerization, CI/CD, and Kubernetes deployment.
- Implement real world patterns: decoupled services, asynchronous event processing, and infrastructure-as-code.
- Exercise local Kubernetes and CI pipelines to simulate operational deployment workflows.


## Quick Summary 

Transforms a long URL into a unique, shortened shortcode that redirects to the original resource.

## Prerequisites

If you would like to build, run, and test this project with docker compose you will need to have the following items installed

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 

2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (may be included with docker)

## Endpoints:

The fields needed for the GRPC endpoints for url-service can be seen in proto/url_service.proto

    rpc CreateShortURL(CreateURLRequest) returns (CreateURLResponse);
    
    rpc GetOriginalURL(GetURLRequest) returns (GetURLResponse);
    
    rpc HealthCheck(HealthRequest) returns (HealthResponse);


## Docker Instructions

To run the url-service you can use the docker compose command to spin up the url service as well as the postgres database.

`
docker compose up -d --build
`



## Testing

Current unit tests exists for url-service under internal/service/url-service_test.go.

End to end testing exists under cmd/test-client/main.go

To test first ensure url-service and postgres are running. 
`
docker ps
`
If they are not running then run the command to build the docker images and start them

`
docker compose up -d --build
`

To run the test client run this command

`
go run cmd/test-client/main.go
`

To run unit tests with coverage 

`
go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
`

To see an HTML report

`
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
`

For full validation server needs to be hosted and endpoints tested manually end to end.

### Example Usage (Minimal)

Currently only the internal URL service exists. You can create and retrieve URLs by accessing the service through gRPC.

1. Build images and spin up docker containers  (See Docker Instructions)

2. Health Check

`
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{}' localhost:50051 urlservice.URLService.HealthCheck
`

3. Create a short URL (you need to pass a URL as well as a user id)


`
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"original_url":"https://example.com","user_id":"user123"}' localhost:50051 urlservice.URLService.CreateShortURL
`

Response:

`
{
  "shortCode": "UBs3cx",
  "shortUrl": "http://localhost:8080/UBs3cx",
  "success": true
}
`

4. Retrieve the original URL from the short code generated 

`
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"short_code":"UBs3cx"}' localhost:50051 urlservice.URLService.G
etOriginalURL
`

Response: 

`
{
  "originalUrl": "https://example.com",
  "found": true
}
`

## Goals and Roadmap 

### New Goals (Distributed Architecture)
Current goals are to build out this project with distributed architecture.
There will be 3 services

1. url-service 
    - internal service handling URL creation and deletion
    - database interactions and URL logic
2. gateway-service
    - external facing REST API
    - translates REST requests to gRPC calls to url-service
    - send events to analytics service on URL hits
3. analytics-service
    - internal service that will track user clicks and usage
    - aggregate data for reporting and insights.


### Sprint Plan
Sprint 1: Microservice architecture split from monolith (Complete)

Sprint 2: gRPC server setup for internal communication (Complete)

Sprint 3: url-service implementation with full DB integration (Complete)

Sprint 4: gateway-service implementation with REST to gRPC translation (Completed)

Sprint 5: analytics-service implementation and event pipeline setup (Completed)

Sprint 6: User authentication and authorization service (Pushed back)

Sprint 7: Cloud deployment with CI/CD pipelines and monitoring (In progress)

Sprint 8: Performance optimization and horizontal scaling of services
